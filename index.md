## Overview

Jamb-UH-ree is a hub for students at UH Manoa to find and connect with each other in order to plan jam sessions. The Jamb-UH-ree organization's GitHub can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/jamb-uh-ree">here</a>.


## Future Plans

The Jamb-UH-ree application will allow users to make an account, add information to that account, and browse/filter through a list of other accounts to find others that would like to participate in a jam session.
